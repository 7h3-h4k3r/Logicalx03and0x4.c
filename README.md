# Anagram Finder and Armstrong Number Checker

## Description
This repository contains two separate functionalities:

1. **Anagram Finder**: A tool that checks whether two given strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.

2. **Armstrong Number Checker**: A tool that checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \( 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153 \).

## Features
- **Anagram Finder**:
  - Takes two input strings.
  - Determines if they are anagrams of each other by comparing their sorted characters.
  
- **Armstrong Number Checker**:
  - Takes an integer input.
  - Checks if the number is an Armstrong number by performing a calculation based on its digits.

## How to Use

1. **Anagram Finder**:
   - Input two strings.
   - The program will output whether the two strings are anagrams.

2. **Armstrong Number Checker**:
   - Input a number.
   - The program will output whether the number is an Armstrong number.

## Example

### Anagram Finder
Input: `"listen"`, `"silent"`
Output: `"Yes, they are anagrams!"`

### Armstrong Number Checker
Input: `153`
Output: `"Yes, 153 is an Armstrong number!"`
